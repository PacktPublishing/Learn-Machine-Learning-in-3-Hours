## About the Video Course
	Given the constantly increasing amounts of data they're faced with, programmers have to come up with better solutions to make machines smarter and reduce manual work. In this Machine Learning course, you'll use Python to craft better solutions and process them effectively.
We start by focusing on key ML algorithms and how they can be trained for classification and regression. We will also work with Supervised and Unsupervised learning to help to get to grips with both types of algorithm. We will use the highly popular Scikit-learn library throughout the course while performing various ML tasks.
By the end of the course, you will be adept at using the concepts and algorithms involved in Machine Learning. This is a highly practical course and will equip you with sufficient hands-on training to help you implement ML skills right after finishing the course.
